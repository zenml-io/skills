## Phase 1: Investigation

**Use subagents to gather information efficiently.** This keeps verbose output out of the main conversation while enabling parallel investigation.

### Recommended: Parallel Subagent Investigation

Spawn **both subagents in parallel** using a single Task tool call with multiple invocations:

```
Use the Task tool to launch BOTH agents simultaneously:

1. zenml-quick-wins:zenml-stack-investigator agent:
   - Prompt: "Investigate the ZenML stack configuration for this project.
     Run all the ZenML CLI commands to understand stacks, components,
     and recent pipeline activity. Return a structured summary."

2. zenml-quick-wins:zenml-codebase-analyzer agent:
   - Prompt: "Analyze the Python codebase for ZenML patterns and quick win
     opportunities. Search for pipeline definitions, current feature usage,
     and areas for improvement. Return a structured summary."
```

Both agents run concurrently and return structured summaries. Synthesize their findings before proceeding to Phase 2.

### What the Subagents Investigate

**zenml-quick-wins:zenml-stack-investigator** (Bash-focused, Haiku model):
- Runs `zenml status`, `zenml stack list`, `zenml stack describe`
- Checks for experiment trackers, alerters, secrets, code repos, models
- Fetches recent pipeline runs
- Returns: Stack configuration, component status, pipeline activity summary

**zenml-quick-wins:zenml-codebase-analyzer** (Read-only, Haiku model):
- Searches for `@pipeline`, `@step` decorators
- Checks for `log_metadata`, `tags=`, `Model(`, `HTMLString`, `Schedule`
- Flags hardcoded credentials (security concern)
- Returns: Feature adoption status, quick win opportunities, security concerns

### Pattern Reference for Analysis

| Pattern | Indicates | Quick Win Opportunity |
|---------|-----------|----------------------|
| `@pipeline` without `tags=` | No tagging | #9 Tags |
| `@step` without `log_metadata` | No metadata | #1 Metadata |
| No `HTMLString` imports | No HTML reports | #11 Reports |
| No `Model()` usage | No model governance | #12 Model Control Plane |
| Hardcoded credentials | Security risk | #7 Secrets |
| No `Schedule` imports | Manual runs | #5 Scheduling |

### Fallback: Manual Investigation

If subagents are unavailable, run these commands directly.

**First, activate the Python environment:**

```bash
# Check for uv project
if [ -f "pyproject.toml" ] && command -v uv &> /dev/null; then
    # Use "uv run zenml ..." for all commands below
    echo "Using uv - prefix commands with 'uv run'"
fi

# Or activate venv/conda
source .venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null || source venv/bin/activate 2>/dev/null || echo "No venv found"

# Verify zenml is available
zenml version
```

**Then run the investigation commands:**

```bash
# Core stack info
zenml status
zenml stack list --output=json
zenml stack describe

# Component details
zenml experiment-tracker list 2>/dev/null || echo "No experiment trackers"
zenml alerter list 2>/dev/null || echo "No alerters configured"
zenml secret list 2>/dev/null || echo "No secrets or no access"
zenml code-repository list 2>/dev/null || echo "No code repos connected"
zenml model list 2>/dev/null || echo "No models registered"

# Recent runs (check for metadata usage)
zenml pipeline runs list --size=10 --output=json 2>/dev/null
```

### MCP Server Check

If ZenML MCP server is available, use it for deeper exploration:

```bash
# Check if zenml MCP tools are available
# If yes, use them to query pipelines, runs, artifacts
```

---

## Phase 2: Confirm Understanding ⏸️

**IMPORTANT: Stop and check in with the user before proceeding.**

After investigation, summarize what you've learned and use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to confirm your understanding. This prevents wasted effort from misunderstandings.

### What to Summarize

Present your findings clearly:

1. **Stack Configuration**
   - Which stacks exist (local, staging, production, etc.)
   - What the active stack contains (orchestrator type, artifact store, etc.)
   - Any connected components (experiment trackers, alerters, secrets stores)

2. **Pipeline Execution Patterns**
   - How pipelines appear to be run (manual vs scheduled vs triggered)
   - If schedules exist, note them explicitly
   - Any orchestrator-specific patterns (Airflow DAGs, Kubeflow pipelines, etc.)

3. **Current Feature Usage**
   - Which ZenML features are already in use (metadata, tags, models, etc.)
   - What's missing that could be quick wins

### Confirmation Questions

Use `AskUserQuestion` with questions like:

**Stack Usage:**
- "I found these stacks: [list]. Which is your primary development stack, and which is production?"
- "Is `default` stack used for local development, or do you use a different one?"

**Pipeline Execution:**
- "I see [N] recent runs. Are these primarily manual runs, or is there a schedule I might have missed?"
- "The pipeline appears to run on [orchestrator]. Is this your main execution environment?"

**Feature Gaps:**
- "I noticed [feature] isn't being used yet. Is that intentional, or an area you'd like to improve?"

### Example Confirmation Message

```markdown
## 📋 Here's what I understand about your ZenML setup:

**Stacks:**
- `default` - Local stack (seems to be for development)
- `aws-production` - AWS stack with SageMaker orchestrator

**Active Stack:** `default` (LocalOrchestrator, local artifact store)

**Recent Activity:**
- 47 pipeline runs in the last month
- All appear to be manual runs (no schedules detected)
- Using `training_pipeline` and `inference_pipeline`

**Current Features:**
- ✅ Basic pipeline structure
- ❌ No metadata logging detected
- ❌ No tags on pipelines
- ❌ No Model Control Plane usage

**Questions for you:**
1. Is `default` your local dev stack and `aws-production` for production?
2. Are these pipelines meant to run on a schedule, or is manual execution intentional?
3. Any other stacks or environments I should know about?
```

Wait for user confirmation before proceeding to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: Gather Context ⏸️

**IMPORTANT: Gather tacit knowledge that isn't captured in code.**

Before making recommendations, ask about context that affects implementation choices. Use `AskUserQuestion` to learn about:

### Infrastructure Context

- "Are there any infrastructure constraints or gotchas I should know about?"
- "Any cloud resource limits, network restrictions, or compliance requirements?"
- "Is there a shared artifact store, or does each environment have its own?"

### Development Environment

- "How do you typically develop and test pipelines locally before deploying?"
- "Do you use a specific IDE, and is there any tooling I should be aware of?"
- "Any CI/CD pipelines that interact with ZenML?"

### Team Dynamics

- "Is this a solo project or does a team work on these pipelines?"
- "If team: any conventions or patterns the team follows that I should maintain?"
- "Any upcoming changes or migrations planned that might affect recommendations?"

### Operational Patterns

- "How do you currently monitor pipeline health and failures?"
- "When something breaks, how do you typically find out?"
- "Any preferences for where alerts should go (Slack, email, etc.)?"

### Example Context Gathering

```markdown
## 🔍 Before I make recommendations, some questions:

**Infrastructure:**
- Any constraints I should know about (resource limits, compliance, network)?
- Anything that's worked poorly in the past with this setup?

**Development:**
- How does local development/testing work for your team?
- Any CI/CD integration with ZenML?

**Team:**
- Solo project or team? (affects things like git hooks, naming conventions)
- Any established patterns or conventions I should follow?

**Operations:**
- How do you currently learn about pipeline failures?
- Preferences for alerting (Slack, Discord, email)?
```

Incorporate this context into your recommendations in Phase 4.

Use `AskUserQuestion` to ask which quick wins they want to implement based on your findings and their priorities. Present the most relevant options first based on the context gathered in previous phases.

---

## Phase 5: Prepare ⏸️

**IMPORTANT: Verify git and branch setup before making any changes.**

Before implementing any quick wins, ensure the codebase is ready for changes.

### Git Status Check

```bash
# Check current branch and status
git status
git branch --show-current

# Check for uncommitted changes
git diff --stat
```

### Branch Confirmation

Use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm branch setup:

```markdown
## 🌿 Before I make changes, let's confirm the branch setup:

**Current state:**
- Branch: `main` (or whatever branch)
- Status: [clean / X uncommitted changes]

**Questions:**
1. Should I create a feature branch for these changes? (Recommended: `feature/zenml-quick-wins`)
2. If yes, is `main` the correct base branch, or should I branch from somewhere else (e.g., `develop`)?
3. Any branch naming conventions I should follow?
```

### Create Feature Branch (if confirmed)

```bash
# Create and checkout feature branch
git checkout -b feature/zenml-quick-wins

# Or with their naming convention
git checkout -b <their-preferred-name>
```

### Why This Matters

- Prevents accidental commits to protected branches
- Allows easy rollback if something goes wrong
- Follows standard development workflow practices
- Makes it easier to review changes before merging

### Implementation Approach ⏸️

Before starting implementation, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask about the preferred approach:

```markdown
## 📝 How would you like to proceed with implementation?

**Option A: Write a plan first (Recommended)**
I can write a detailed implementation plan as a `.md` file that you can:
- Review and share with your team before changes are made
- Use as documentation of what will be implemented
- Reference during code review

After the plan is approved, I'd recommend compacting this session to start fresh with clean context for implementation.

**Option B: Proceed directly to implementation**
I'll start implementing the selected quick wins right away.

**Questions:**
1. Would you like a written plan first, or shall we proceed directly?
2. If writing a plan: where should I save it? (e.g., `docs/zenml-quick-wins-plan.md`)
```

**Why offer this choice:**
- Teams often want to review proposed changes before implementation
- A written plan serves as documentation and can be referenced in PRs
- Compacting the session before implementation clears investigation context, keeping the model focused on the task at hand
- Some users prefer to move fast; others prefer deliberate planning

---

## Phase 6: Implementation

See [quick-wins-catalog.md](quick-wins-catalog.md) for detailed implementation guides for each quick win.

### Implementation Checklist Pattern

For each quick win, follow this pattern:

```
- [ ] Verify prerequisites met
- [ ] Implement the change
- [ ] Test the implementation
- [ ] Document what was done
```

---

## Phase 7: Verification

After implementing, verify with:

```bash
# Check stack configuration
zenml stack describe

# Run a test pipeline (if applicable)
python your_pipeline.py

# Verify in dashboard (ZenML Pro)
# Check metadata, tags, model versions appear correctly
```

---

## Troubleshooting & Documentation

### When to Use Web Search

If implementation fails or documentation seems outdated:
1. Search `site:docs.zenml.io <topic>` for latest docs
2. Check specific component documentation

### Install ZenML Docs MCP Server

For better IDE assistance during implementation:

**Claude Code (VS Code):**
```bash
claude mcp add zenmldocs --transport http https://docs.zenml.io/~gitbook/mcp
```

**Cursor:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zenmldocs": {
      "transport": {
        "type": "http",
        "url": "https://docs.zenml.io/~gitbook/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
